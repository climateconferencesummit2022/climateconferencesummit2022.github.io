         <h2>About the Theme</h2>  
        <p>Deforestation is “ the cleaning or thinning of forests by humans.”  Fueled from greed, overpopulation, a decrease in resources, problems largely pertaining to the ones of humans. Yet, we only solve these problems by creating new ones in confidence that our immediate issues have been resolved. The accumulation of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gasses, and climate change, all pushed to the back. Moreover, we have yet to even fully consider the loss of biodiversity, habitat, beauty, as consequences. Now, we can only work together to make up for the forests stolen in this long history of deforestation.  Join us on our first day of this conference  to embark on a path to save our planet! </p>

                      <p>
                         Originally from Finland, Celina completed her degree in environmental studies in the esteemed college, Berkeley, California. Cultivating her passion for helping the world from a young age, she set her sights on making a real change after her education. She founded One Tree One Life, a widely spread non-profit organization actively fighting against climate change, mainly through reforestation.  Gathering around 300,000 plus activists over these past few years, the organization has had a big part in funding and helping major reforestation projects in places from the Amazon to gravely affected local communities.

 <h2>Iman Wil (Evening) </h2>
                      <p>
                        Growing up in Nigeria, Iman started experiencing the effects of deforestation all around her at an early age. Losing approximately 55% of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005, things didn’t seem to be getting any better.  With local support and a set goal, she set out to increase awareness and have more of a voice in the environmental practices around her. Starting her non-profit organization and campaign, One With Nature, in just her 20’s, Iman has been steadily increasing the reach and actions of this organization. From setting up the small scale to big scale projects on replanting trees and educational classes, Iman is healing the nature around her, slowly but surely.

            <p> This initiative allows our organization to work with farmers to teach them about regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agriculture practices include no till agriculture, composting, using biochar, and planting perennial plants when possible. These practices improve soil health by increasing organic matter, which increases biodiversity and carbon drawdown (taking carbon out of the atmosphere).
